patches/:
* patches/systemd-compat adds systemd-specific checks

* patches/tlp-functions_noperl removes the perl dependency from tlp-functions
  (replaces a single "perl -pe" command with "sed -e")
  Note that this patch doesn't modify the regex in the perl(->sed) command;
  it's still assumed that ~$BAY_DEVICE is exactly 3 chars long ("sr0", not "sr10")
  --> propose a patch upstream:
  + poweroff_drivebay(): change regex to 's!/block/[^\/]*$!!'
  ++ OR simply use the shell's builtin non-greedy variable substitution:
  ++ > syspath="/sys$($UDEVADM info...)"
  ++ > syspath="${syspath%/block/*}"
  + poweroff_drivebay(): fix [ -n "$syspath" ] check; syspath always starts with /sys


addons/:
* addons/build-scripts contains/ helper scripts for tlp.mk

* addons/fake_lsb_release is a lsb_release replacement for tlp-stat
  (reads /etc/os-release and prints $PRETTY_NAME)

* addons/tpacpi-bat.null is a dummy tpacpi-bat shell script that returns
  "not supported"

* addons/devlist-sh/ is a reimplementation of tlp-{pci,usb}list in shell code,
  this allows to install tlp+tlp-stat without perl
  (tpacpi-bat still requires perl)


Notes:
* systemd is a hard dependency. sysV needs pm-utils (not available in BR)

* overall, sources are modified heavily (patches + sed-editing) and the
  installation doesn't follow upstream's guidelines closely,
  so consider this variant _UNSUPPORTED_
  (for example, tlp-{pci,usb}list and tpacpi-bat are replaced with custom
  scripts, depending on what's configured)

* no tlp.conf.ups present/written (using .nobat instead)

* rfkill packaged separately, unsure if rfkill from busybox is sufficient

* unsure about the sed dependency (maybe busybox sed works, too)
* ^~ gawk

* addons/devlist-sh should be moved to somewhere else,
  e.g. gentoo-additions repo

* Config.in: check select/depends on
