* TLP needs udev and (systemd||pm-utils)
   pm-utils is not packaged, so systemd is a hard dependency

* rfkill packaged separately (in this repo),
  unsure if rfkill from busybox is sufficient [NEEDS TESTING]

* unsure about the sed dependency (maybe busybox sed works, too) [NEEDS TESTING]

* ^~ (g)awk [NEEDS TESTING]

* overall, sources are modified heavily (patches + sed-editing) and the
  installation doesn't follow upstream's guidelines closely,
  so consider this variant _UNSUPPORTED_
  (for example, tlp-{pci,usb}list and tpacpi-bat are replaced with custom
  scripts, depending on what's configured)

* buildroot has no lsb_release package, using a naive script as replacement



deviations from upstream
------------------------

* freely definable config file location
   (upstream: /etc/default/tlp, br: /etc/tlp.conf)

* ".nobat" config file for systems w/o a battery [optional]

* systemd-compat patch, disables nm workaround in tlp-rf-func

* removal of thinkpad-radiosw, which relies on deprecated kernel features
  (PROC_ACPI_EVENT, removed as of linux 3.12)

* modularized wireless functionality

* shell code replacements for tlp-{usb,pci}list,
  which removes the perl dependency from tlp[-stat] [optional]

* dummy tpacpi-bat script for replacing the original one (which needs perl),
  for non-ThinkPad systems [optional]

* exposure of TLP_LOAD_MODULES, TLP_DEBUG config options
